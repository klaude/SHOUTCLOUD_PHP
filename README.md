SHOUTCLOUD_PHP
=================================

AUTOMATE CALLS TO [SHOUTCLOUD](http://shoutcloud.io/) FOR YOUR WORDPRESS PLUGINS OR WHATEVER. WHY?

* BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORTH SAYING IF IT'S NOT SAID IN ALL CAPS.
* BECAUSE YOU WANT BLOCKING I/O IN YOUR STRING MANIPULATION.
* BECAUSE CLOUD SERVICES ARE ALWAYS BETTER.
* BECAUSE B2B.
* BECAUSE YOU'RE PROBABLY ALREADY SHOUTING ON REDDIT/HACKER NEWS/4CHAN/WHATEVER ANYWAYS.

I DO NOT RUN SHOUTCLOUD OR MAKE CLAIMS TO IT'S AVAILABILITY. ALL I AM DOING IS MAKING IT EASIER TO YELL A LOT OVER THE INTERNET IN PHP. GO AWAY.

INSTALLATION
------------
USE [COMPOSER](http://getcomposer.org/)!

ADD `"klaude/SHOUTCLOUD_PHP": "dev-master"` TO YOUR PROJECT'S `composer.json` FILE'S REQUIRE SECTION:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "klaude/SHOUTCLOUD_PHP": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

BAM. NOW YOUR CAPS LOCK KEY IS WEB SCALE.

USAGE
-----
CALL `SHOUTCLOUD\UPCASE()` LIKE IT AIN'T NO THING.

```php
// WAY BETTER THAN STRTOUPPER()!
echo SHOUTCLOUD\UPCASE('hey you guys!');

```
